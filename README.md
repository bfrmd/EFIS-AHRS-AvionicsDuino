# EFIS-AHRS-AvionicsDuino
AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) software for the AvionicsDuino EFIS

See : https://avionicsduino.com/index.php/en/the-ahrs/

WARNING!

Version 2.0 or later of this software should only be used with the EFIS_remote_ module software version 2.0 or later and the EFIS software version 3.0 or later. This is due to major modifications to the CAN bus configuration required when removing the UART serial communication line that connected the EFIS to the AHRS and hooking the AHRS up to the CAN bus. 

Version 1.3 should be used with EFIS_Remote_Module V 1.0, EFIS V 2.5, and a UART serial communication line between AHRS and EFIS.
